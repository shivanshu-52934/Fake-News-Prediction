Fake News Prediction using Logistic Regression

Introduction:
This project aims to classify news articles as either real or fake using machine learning techniques. Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, and having automated tools to detect misinformation can be crucial for maintaining information integrity.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of news articles labeled as either real or fake. It includes features such as the title, author, and content of the articles.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: The data underwent preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to prepare it for model training.

Feature Engineering: The textual data was converted into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

Model Training: A Logistic Regression model was trained on the TF-IDF vectors to classify news articles.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics on both the training and testing datasets.

Prediction: A predictive system was implemented to classify new news articles as real or fake.

Results:
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 98.66% on the training data and 97.91% on the testing data, indicating strong performance in classifying real and fake news articles.
The predictive system successfully categorizes new news articles as real or fake, aiding in automated misinformation detection.

Future Improvements:

Explore other machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods for potentially improving model performance.
Enhance data preprocessing techniques to capture more nuanced features from the textual data.
Deploy the model as a web service or integrate it into browser extensions to provide real-time fake news detection.
